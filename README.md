# ESASky

ESASky is a science-driven discovery portal providing full access to the entire sky as observed with Space astronomy missions. Using the Matomo user analytics tool, we collected thousandths of data points from all the clicks done by all ESASky users. The preliminary results show how our users use the essential ESASky tools, how they interact with implemented features and which parts of the sky do they explore more statistically.
